# Connect-Four
This is my final project for my CIS 1051 class. It is the game of Connect Four. You can find the video of my demonstration at https://youtu.be/NE8cSYmMc4I
There is a slight glitch occasionally where the "yes" text will not appear.
This is a complete mystery to me, as if any win text appears, all of the text should appear, not some of it. I had a lot of fun making this project because I am
an avid enjoyer of videogames, and making one of my own is a dream come true.
Some difficulties I faced when making this were learning how to use pygame, and a specific issue I had where the win text would not go away when the game board was reset.
I spent a few days trying to fix this to no avail, until I finally found a solution in the place I least expected it.
I learned a lot about how pygame works and it gave me insight as to how difficult making a game can be. I have a lot more respect for developers who make videogames now,
who make amazing games for people to enjoy.
