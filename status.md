Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have learned how to use pygame, at least the parts that I need to use so far. I have also made the base game of connect four. I made the board that shows where the pieces go and coded the inner workings of the game.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not put in a win screen just yet, although I dont foresee that being too difficult. I also need to try and make the cpu for a lone player to play against, which is more tough.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

It took me a while to install pygame and learn how to use it. I found the difference between surfaces and (objects?) regular shapes like rectangles and circles to be confusing at first.
