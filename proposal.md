# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

It will probably just be Connect Four.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It is a recreation of the game Connect Four using pygame.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The game will start by creating the connect four board with elements from pygame. It will then take input by mouse to determine where to put the next piece. The color of the piece will alternate every time a piece is placed, and the value for each move will be stored for later use. Once the game is over, a win screen will be displayed saying which player won and it will ask if the player(s) want to play again. I am also thinking of making a cpu that one person can play against.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will make a working game of connect four that follows the rules of the game. And it will have a win screen at the end which says who won.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Beyond the stuff just mentioned, I want to ask if the players want to play again, if possible, and reset the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I really want to try making a cpu for a lone player to play against but it does seem like a daunting task.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to download pygame and learn how to use it so I can make the game look pretty. It would also allow for the use of the mouse as an input device when determining where to put a piece. I need to think of a way to make an "AI" as well, so I will need to do some research on the best ways of completing that. Then I will have to code the actual game and fix any problems that may occur. I am sure it will not go exactly as planned.
